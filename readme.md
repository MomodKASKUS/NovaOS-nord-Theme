# Nova-galactic-theme
Inspired by the Nordic Darker theme, but adjusted for coherency and simplicity. The theme includes configs for cinnamon, gnome-shell, gtk-2.0, gtk-3.0, gtk-4.0, metacity, as well as vscode, terminator, firefox and obsidian.

**NOTICE**: Only tested on Linux Mint 20. I suggest using the theme as a reference.

Check out the accompanying [icon-pack](https://github.com/NicklasVraa/Nova-galactic-icons) and try the theme with redshift.

This was created for [NovaOS](https://github.com/NicklasVraa/NovaOS), a spin on the brilliant Linux Mint, on which I am currently working.
